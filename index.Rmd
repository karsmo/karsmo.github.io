#VisuNet: an interactive tool for rule network visualization in R

--

###Overview 

VisuNet is an interactive tool that supports analysis of complex-rule based classifiers and helps explain their structure. VisuNet can be successfully apply to any classification problems, such as, for instance, a complex health-related decsion tasks. Rule networks can clearly identify main genes (metabolites, methylation sites, etc) and their expression levels predicting complex phenotypes, e.g. cancer, autism. VisuNet is implemented in R and uses the Shiny Gadgets attributes. The tool includes the rule network construction, filtration, visualization and customization. VisuNet is available on  [GitHub](https://github.com/komorowskilab/VisuNet.git)


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE}
library(visNetwork)
nodes <- data.frame(id = 1:3)
edges <- data.frame(from = c(1,2), to = c(1,3))

visNetwork(nodes, edges)
```
